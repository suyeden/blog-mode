  ~blog-mode~ is a major mode for Emacs.
  It enables you to easily take notes or make a personal wiki on your Emacs.

** Installation
   First of all, make sure you can use ~Org-mode~ in your Emacs because ~blog-mode~ uses the functions of ~Org-mode~. Please check other websites for more information about ~Org-mode~.
   Then, place ~blog-mode.el~ file in any directory on your computer like ~~/.emacs.d/lisp/~ and add the code below to your Emacs configuration file like ~.emacs~ or ~init.el~.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; Add to your Emacs configuration file
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp")
     (load-library "blog-mode.el")
   #+end_src

** Usage
   When you want to start ~blog-mode~, press ~C-c b~.
   ~/org/blog~ directory will be created under your home directory and blog-mode related files will be created here.
   ~M-x blog-mode~ can also be used to enable ~blog-mode~ on your current document.
   You can see ~help~ with ~C-c C-h~. To quit from ~help~, type ~q~.

   You can use the key bindings and the functions below.

   To attach a stylesheet to exported HTML files, edit ~~/org/blog/css/style.css~.
   When you want to change your blog's title (~#+TITLE~ of ~index.org~), author's name, and your language, edit ~index.org~ directly.
